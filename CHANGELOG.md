### v6.7.288.46.0, v6.7.288.46.1 - 2017-07-06

* Update upstream v8 version to 6.7.288.46 (https://github.com/cowboyd/libv8/pull/258)
  Due to the change in V8's build system this causes several major changes until
  we're able to find a way to reimplement the necessary functionality. The changes
  are listed below.
* Remove the option to specify --with-cxx. For now V8 is built with the
  toolchain provided by the build system (https://github.com/cowboyd/libv8/issues/260)
* Remove the option to specify --with-system-v8. It was making it too easy for
  the user to shot themself in the foot.
* Drop ARM support. The V8 build system is not working natively on ARM and for
  some reason crosscompilation produces X86 binaries
  (https://github.com/cowboyd/libv8/issues/261)
* Drop FreeBSD support. Chromium's depot_tools do not support FreeBSD at this
  point. (https://github.com/cowboyd/libv8/issues/253)
