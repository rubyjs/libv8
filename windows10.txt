I compiled the Makefile in Windows 10 administrator. 
Installed rubygems dependencies:
bundle, patch, rbconfig, mkmf, openS3, yaml, pathname2, shell_tools, shell-utils.

Downloaded patch gnuwin32 sourceforge.net and edited path variable for patch.exe.

Changed directory for patch.exe in /libv8/ext/libv8/patcher.rb.

Added dependencies from libv8.gemspec.
